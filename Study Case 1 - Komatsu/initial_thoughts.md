# Study Case - Komatsu and its Digital Transformation

## The Case

Founded in 1921 by Meitaro Takeuchi, Komatsu is a Japanese multinational corporation that manufactures construction, mining, forestry and military equipment, as well as diesel engines and industrial equipment like press machines, lasers and thermoelectric generators. Its headquarters are in Minato, Tokyo, Japan.

Komatsu is the second world's largest manufacturer of construction equipment and mining equipment aftearger share than Caterpillar. It has manufacturing operations in Japan, Asia, Americas and Europe.

During 2018, the then CEO of Komatsu, Tetsuji Ohashi, presented the board with the company's mid-term management plan, for 2019 to 2021 which would cost $1.6 billion. Most of the invesment would be to Komatsu's Smart construction initiative, which englobes:
- Internet of Things (IoT)
- Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- Autonomous Driving (AD)
- Big Data

The initiative's intent is to offer a digitally integrated management solution for the entire construction processs.

The investment would support the development of the software necessary to grow the business, and roll it out beyond the home market of Japan. The company aimed to increase its revenue from Smart Construction sales from tens of millions of dollars to $300 million by 2025, a 30-fold increase.

### Motivation behind the smart construction initiative

Komatsu's President & CEO, Ohashi, strongly believed that connectivity and automation were essential for enhancing productivity and safety in construction. The concept of "Smart Construction" aimed to digitally link all construction processess:

</p>

Data from various sources like drones, construction machines, the internet, and third-party surveyors would be uploaded to a digital platform. Software applications would then create and continuously update daily work plans, while automated equipment would execute tasks. This vision extended beyond autonomous machinery, emphasizing the complete digital integration of construction site processes.

To pursue this vision, Komatsu established a new division called the Smart Construction Promotion Division in 2015, with Chikashi Shike as its President. Shike, previously a successful entrepreneur in construction machinery rentals, was attracted to the project by Ohashi's commitment and support for his entrepreneurial approach. Ohashi acknowledged Shike's innovative thinking and aimed to collaborate closely on the project, despite potential resistance from within the company.

Komatsu had invested approximately $30 million in developing Smart Construction and deployed 300 consultants to dealerships in Japan to support its sales. By March 2019, Smart Construction had been used at over 10,000 job sites in Japan, with a 2% market penetration.

Despite the progress, Ohashi was not entirely satisfied and sought to expand the Smart Construction business. The question remained whether this significant investment was worthwhile.

### The Company

#### History & Performance

The company had quite the sucess within the Japanese market, as it had grew rapidly before WWII and soon became the leader of its field within the country.

However, in 1963, Caterpillar, the world's largest manufacturer of construction and mining equipment, entered the Japanese market. Komatstu's products quality was deemed as inferior at the time. The company's response was to focus on improving its products and services, and expanding gloabally.

#### Culture of Mono and Koto

When Ohashi took over as CEO & President in 2013, he became concerned that Komatsu had become too product-centric. Ohashi believed that the company needed to "put themselves in the shoes of the customer".

In 2007, the company lauched its brand management activities whose goal was to face the customer and emphasize with their problems. Oshashi hoped to build on top of this by combining elements from customer-centric and product-centric approaches, to generate both manufacturing ("MONO", tangible) and service ("KOTO", intangible) solutions.

Shike particularly emphasized the importance of the balance between both for the success of the Smart Construction initiative. He believed that the company should not be transformed completly into a KOTO company nor make a paradigm shift to a MONO company. The company should remain a manufacturing company.

He wants employee to understand both KOTO and MONO elements.

Shike's observed that the main difference between the two approaches were:
- MONO business are required to have a full-fledged 100% quality product that meets the customer's needs as soon as it reaches the market, while KOTO business adjust the content of its service even after its debut on the market.
- The product-out approach of a MONO business means that the value created is known in advance, but not so for a KOTO business. For manufacturing, once products are released, the usage of the product is out of the company's control and in the customer's hands. KOTO business required to "go along" with the customer who are using the service.
- The KOTO part of Smart Construction provides a wider scope of customer support. It includes technology and services that were not originally developed by Komatsu, such as drones.

Shike recalls that one of the most diffictul tasks for the Smart Construction division was to promote a KOTO mindset on the employees that had been exposed only to ate MONO mindset.

### The Construction Industry

In Japan, construction work, especially in public projects, was typically managed by a single general contractor who subcontracted various specialized tasks to different parties, each with their own methods.

Smart Construction revolutionized this approach by introducing a dynamic 3D map of the construction site, regularly updated and accessible to all involved parties. It also provided project management tools to oversee the entire workflow, integrating previously separate processes and stakeholders. This innovation aimed to enhance efficiency and collaboration in construction projects.

The construction process at a building site can be categorized into the following five major steps:

#### Survey

Traditionally, surveying a site "required people to walk through the site and perform measurements every 20m with theodolites on tripods or with tape measures, which was time-consuming and inaccurate".

> From this moment SC is used as an abbreviation for Smart Construction. I'm lazy :P

With SC, drones survey the land daily and employ Edgebox software, developed by Komatsu, to clean the data such as eliminating trees and houses on the plan. In 2019, SC had partnerships with 91 out of 10000 Japanese surveyors.

#### Design

Data gathered from a site survey would be incorporated into the architect’s or engineer’s
design and overlaid with other relevant inputs, such as underground pipework.

SC enabled the creation of 3D data that could be viewed in multiple devices, without the need CAD software. This data could be shared with all stakeholders, including the construction company, the general contractor, and the subcontractors.

The support center could convert non-digital architectural drawings into 3D data, which was invaluable throughout the construction process, aiding inspections and comparisons between the current state, initial site conditions, and the overall design.


#### Plan

In the planning phase, SC facilitated calculations for soil volume, area, and distance, enabling optimized routes for bulldozers, scheduling of dump trucks, and coordination of materials and labor. Advanced software factored in weather conditions and tracked site changes, all viewable on the app dashboard for on-site access.

#### Construction

During construction, various tasks like loading, embankment, and excavation were executed, with the specific activities varying based on the project type. Komatsu's ICT equipment, particularly excavators and bulldozers, automated tasks like stake marking by using 3D design data. Positional sensors on the equipment collected updated topography data, which was shared among stakeholders via the platform.

#### Inspection

For inspections, Smart Construction simplified the traditionally paper-based process. It generated color-coded heat maps highlighting areas requiring attention, streamlining the regulatory inspection process in public works construction.

## Questions for In-Class Discussion

1. What is the incumbent business model of the traditional Komatsu organisation, and how has it evolved with digitalisation?
2. What is the new business model of Komatsu's Smart Construction division, and what is the role of digitalisation in that business model?
